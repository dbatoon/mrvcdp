This prototype builds upon the foundation aid out in a previous research by Michael Homer, [ACM Digital Library](https://doi.org/10.1145/3594671.3594681), which aims  to enhance user experience and empower users with a diverse set of tools for expressing and manipulating data-flow programs. The live version of the existing prototype can be found [here](https://mwh.nz/demos/px2023). The source code is accessible [here](https://github.com/mwh/mrvcdp).
